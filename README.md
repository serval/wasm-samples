# wasm-samples

This is a collection of sample WASM applications, intended to be used to demonstrate various pieces of functionality as we develop them.

Each top-level directory should be a standalone Rust project (e.g. the result of `cargo new <something>`).

## Initial setup

Your development machine will need to have the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs) installed:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
