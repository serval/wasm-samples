# LOUDify

This program converts any standard input to a format that can be understood by a LOUDBOT compatible agent such as [LOUDCRAB](https://github.com/ceejbot/LOUDCRAB).

Currently, LOUDify converts raw input verbatim. Going forward, it should probably deserialize a JSON payload into a known data structure, operate on the actual input field, and produce an appropriate response structure to output.
